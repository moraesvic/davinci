After running populate_db :
	no size reduce		: 7.0 M
	max 800 px			: 5.2 M
	max 600 px			: 4.2 M
	max 600 px + jpeg	: 2.8 M
	checking every op	: 2.5 M
	same, 300px			: 1.2 M

Remember : it is not so important to reduce image size **in the server**,
but to make pages load faster.

Honestly, 600 px is still too much. Take a look at https://www.kabum.com.br/ ,
all the pictures representing products have dimensions around 200 x 200,
and are mostly under 10 KB.
